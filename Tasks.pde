/* Overall Goals
 *
 * Be able to rearrange individual formulae for a given argument
 * Solve a formula if enough of the arguments are given values
 * Have a (XML?) file from which multiple formulae are loaded
 * Be able to add new formulae and save them to the file
 * Be able to combine formulae to make more complex ones
 * Offer the user extra formulae or outcomes that can be derived from the current formula
 * Have a graphical interface to display formulae nicely
 * Clicking within the graphical interface can rearrange and combine formulae, or specify values for arguments
 */
 
/* Basic tasks
 *
 * / Write out a formula as text
 * Parse a formula from text
 */
 
/* Rearranging formulae
 *
 * Multiply through denominators
 * Expand brackets
 * Swap nodes to opposite sides of formulae
 * Simplify with respect to a specific argument/symbol
